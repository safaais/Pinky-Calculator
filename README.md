# Pinky Calculator - Because Math Should Be Fun!

"Who said calculators have to be boring? Meet **Pinky** - the calculator that's so extra, it even has a `tan()` function!" ðŸŒ¸

---

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide - the usual suspects. 
- **Scientific Mode**: Toggle on/off for advanced math (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.).   
- **Unit Toggle**: Switch between radians and degrees (for all you trigonometry enthusiasts).  
- **Constants**: Quick access to **Ï€ (pi)** and **e (Euler's number)**. 
- **Stylish Design**: Pink-themed UI becauseâ€¦ why not?

## How It Works

### Basic Mode:
- **Numbers & Decimals**: Type in your numbers and decimal points.  
- **Basic Operations**: Use `+`, `-`, `Ã—`, and `Ã·` for standard math.  
- **Clear (C)**: Wipe the slate clean.  
- **Toggle Sign (Â±)**: Flip between positive and negative.  
- **Equals (=)**: Get your results instantly.  

### Scientific Mode:
- **Trig Functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` for all your angle needs.  
- **Other Functions**: Square root (`âˆš`), logarithms (`log`, `ln`).  
- **Exponents**: Raise numbers to a power (`^`).  
- **Constants**: Use `Ï€` and `e` for calculations in one tap.  
- **RAD/DEG**: Switch between radians and degrees.

## Code Structure

- **`_buttonPressed()`**: Handles all button presses (numbers, operators, functions).  
- **`_calculate()`**: Performs basic math operations.  
- **`_performFunction()`**: Handles scientific functions (`sin`, `cos`, etc.).  
- **`_buildButton()`**: Creates styled buttons with dynamic colors.
